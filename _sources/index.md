# MATH 725 Applied Functional Analysis

## Instructor

This is a course given by [Andreas Buttenschoen](www.buttenschoen.ca) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

## Description

This is a one-semester introduction to Functional Analysis: I plan to cover most of the chapters in Hillen (as time permits), as well as some uses for functional analysis in Neural Networks, and numerical tools to explore functional analysis.

* Function Spaces;
* Linear Operators and Subspaces;
* Duality;
* Sobolev Spaces and Distributions;
* Calculus: Integration and Differentiation;
* Fixed Point Theorems (and nonlinear functional analysis);
* Calculus of Variations;
* Spectral theory;
* Semigroup theory;
* Applications of functional analysis:
    * Reaction-diffusion equations.
    * Bifurcation theory;
    * Numerical tools (as time permits);
    * Neural-networks;

If you have any topics of interest please let me know. I have already found some texts that nicely connect functional analysis with stochastic theory, so I might be able to do some examples in that direction.

## Course Text

* [**Elements of Applied Functional Analysis**](https://www.math.ualberta.ca/~thillen/FA-book-June2023.pdf) by [Thomas Hillen](https://www.math.ualberta.ca/~thillen).

## Learning Goals

* Learn functional analysis.
* To be confirmed.

## Construction Warning

These notes are under **heavy** construction, and for the time being will be sequential.

## Mathematical Python resources

* [Mathematical Python](https://patrickwalls.github.io/mathematicalpython/) is a great resource to get started with mathematical python.

## Course Grading tools

* [PLOM Grading](https://plomgrading.org/) will be used to grade quizzes and exams.
