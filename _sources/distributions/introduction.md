# Introduction to Distribution Theory

## Motivation and Overview

In classical analysis, we work with functions that assign specific values to points
in their domain. However, many physical phenomena and mathematical problems require more
general objects that can handle singularities, discontinuities, and other irregular
behaviors. Distribution theory provides this framework by generalizing the concept
of a function.

Distribution (or generalized functions) allow us to:

1. Rigorously define operations like differentiation on functions that are not classically
differentiable.

2. Assign meaning to objects like the Dirac delta ``function'' $\delta(x)$.

3. Provide a unified framework for solving partial differential equations.

4. Handle limiting processes more naturally.
