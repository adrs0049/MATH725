## The Space of Test Functions

We begin by constructing a suitable space of ``test functions'' against which distributions
will be evaluated.

### Definition and Topology

The space $\mathcal{C}_c^\infty(\mathbb{R}^d)$ consists of all infinitely
differentiable functions with compact support on $\mathbb{R}^d$.

To define the topology on $\mathcal{C}_c^\infty(\mathbb{R}^d)$:

1. View $\mathcal{C}_c^\infty(\mathbb{R}^d)$ as the union of spaces $\mathcal{C}_c^\infty(K)$
where $K \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ is compact.

2. We equip each $\mathcal{C}_c^\infty(K)$ with the smooth topology generated by the norm $||f||_{\mathcal{C}^k$.

3. Define seminorms as good when they are continuous on each $\mathcal{C}_c^\infty(K)$.

4. Using these good seminorms we generate the topology on $\mathcal{C}_c^\infty(\mathbb{R}^d)$.

This gives $\mathcal{C}_c^\infty(\mathbb{R}^d)$ the structure of a locally convex
topological vector space.


### Convergence in the Space of Test Functions

A sequence $\left\{ f_n \right\}$ in $\mathcal{C}_c^\infty(\mathbb{R}^d)$ converges to
$f$ if and only if:

1. There exists a compact set $K$ such that all $f_n$ and $f$ are supported in $K$.
2. For every multi-index $\alpha$, $\partial^\alpha f_n$ converges uniformly to
$\partial^\alpha f$.

This is a very **strong** notion of convergence, requiring uniform convergence of all
derivatives and eventual containment of supports in a fixed compact set.

### Properties of test functions

1. **Density:** $\mathcal{C}_c^\infty(\mathbb{R}^d)$ is dense in many function spaces
including $L^p$ for $1 \leq p < \infty$ and $\mathcal{C}_0$.

2. **Partitions of Unity:** For any open cover of a compact set $K$, there exists a
partition of unity consiting of test functions.

3. **Convolution:** If $f \in \mathcal{C}_c^\infty(\mathbb{R}^d)$ and $g$ locally integrable
and compactly supported, then $f * g \in \mathcal{C}_c^\infty(\mathbb{R}^d)$.

4. **Approximation to Identity:** There exist sequences of test functions that converge
to the Dirac delta distribution.
