# The Dual-Space

There are two methods to studying mathematical structures.

1. By looking at the objects **in** the space.
2. By looking at functions **on** the space.

In the Banach space setting the natural mappings to consider are the linear continuous functions between two Banach spaces
$X$ and $Y$. Now consider $\mathcal{L}(X, \mathbb{R})$ the space of bounded linear continuous functionals on $X$.
This is a Banach space, and we will call it the **dual** of $X$ denotes by $X^*$.
