# Examples of dual-spaces

There are three **main** classes of duality.

1. Hilbert spaces are **self-dual** i.e. $X = X^*$.
The geometric view is that each functional corresponds directly to an element in $X$

```{prf:example}

In $\mathbb{R}^n$ each functional arises via the inner product, thus $(\mathbb{R}^n)^* = \mathbb{R}^n)$.
Similarly, for $\mathbb{C}^n$.

```

```{prf:example}

In $L^2(\Omega)$ every functional is given by

$$ f[x] = \int x(t) g(t) \mathrm{d}t,\quad\mbox{for some}\ g \in L^2(\Omega). $$

```


2. Reflexive spaces are those for which $X^{**} = X$.

```{prf:example}

The spaces $L^p(\Omega)$ for $1 < p < \infty$ are reflexive with
$(L^p)^* = L^q$ where $\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1$.

```


3. Non-reflexive spaces are those where $X \subset X^{**}$.

```{prf:example}

$L^\infty(\Omega)$ is not separable i.e. it has too many independent directions.
From the previous result we would guess that $(L^\infty)^* = L^1$ however we know
that functions in $L^1$ correspond to regular measures on $\Omega$. But this won't
let us distinguish / measure functions in $L^\infty$, recall that the topology i.e.
norm on $L^\infty$ is very discrening. Thus we need singular measure function properties
on sets of measure zero.
