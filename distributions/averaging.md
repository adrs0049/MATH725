## Distributions as Averaging Operators

One of the most intuitive ways to understand distributions is to view them as ``averaging
operators'' that extract information through local averaging. This perspective has deep
connections to physical measurements and provides insights into the behaviour of distributions
of different orders.

### Distributions and Measurements

In physics, no measurement can capture a true point value. All physical measurements
involve some form of averaging over a small region. Distributions provide a mathematical
framework that naturally accomodates this reality.

#### Physical Interpretation of Test Functions

When we evaluate a distribution $T$ against a test function $\phi$ to get
$\langle T, \phi \rangle$, we can interpret $\phi$ as the ``response profile''
or ``sensitivity function'' of a measurement device.

1. The support of $\phi$ represents the spatial region over which the measurement
occurs (the ``detection volume'' or ``sampling area'').

2. The shape of $\phi$ encodes how sensitive the detection is at different positions
within that region.

3. The normalization ($\int \phi = 1$) matains consistent units and scales.

4. The smoothness of $\phi$ reflets the ``gentleness'' of the measurement process.

For different physical quantities, the test function has different interpretations.

- For density-like quantities (e.g. mass density, temperature): $\phi(x)$ represents
how strongly the measurements at position $x$ contributes to the final read.

- For field measurements (e.g. electric field) $\phi(x)$ encodes both spatial sampling
and directional sensitivity.

- For flux measurements (e.g. particle or energy flux) $\phi(x)$ represents how the detector
samples both position and orientation.

#### Physical examples

- A thermometer doesn't measure temperature at a single point but averages molecular
kinetic energy over a small volume.

- Electric field measurements average over the test charge's spatial extend.

- Position measurements in quantum mechanics are fundamentally limited by wave-like properties.

Distributions capture this reality mathematically. When we evaluate

$$ \langle T, \phi \rangle$$

where $\phi$ is a test function, we can interpret this as measuring the distribution
$T$ with an apparatus whose sensitivity profile is described by $\phi$.


### Behavior with Concentrating Test Functions

Consider a sequence of ``bump functions'' $\{ \phi_n \}$ that concentrate around a point $x_0$.

- $\phi_n(x) = n^d \phi(n(x-x_0))$ where $\phi$ is a fixed test function with $\int \phi = 1$.
- As $n\to\infty$, $\phi_n$ concentrates at $x_0$ while maintaining $\int\phi_n = 1$.

The behavior of $\langle T, \phi_n \rangle$ as $n\to\infty$ reveals the local structure
of the distribution $T$:

1. **Continuous Functions:** If $T = T_f$ for a continous function $f$, then:

$$
    \lim_{n\to\infty} \langle T_f, \phi_n \rangle = f(x_0)
$$

The averaging process converges to the point value.

2. **Locally Integrable Function:** If $T= T_f$ for $f \in L^1_{\mathrm{loc}}$, then:

$$
    \lim_{n\to\infty} \langle T_f, \phi_n \rangle = f(x_0)
$$

This holds at almost every point $x_0$ (Lebesgue points of $f$).

3. **Radon Measures:** If $T = T_{\mu}$ for a Radon measure
$\mu = c \delta_{x_0} + \nu$, where $\nu(\{ x_0 \}) = 0$, then:

- If $\mu$ has a point mass at $x_0$:

$$
    \lim_{n\to\infty} \langle T_\mu, \phi_n \rangle = \lim_{n\to\infty} c \phi_n(x_0) \sim \mathcal{O}(n^d)
$$

- If $\mu$ is absolutely continuous with density $f$, same behaviour as for the locally integrable functions.

4. **Higher-Order distributions:** For a distribution of order $m$:

$$
    \langle T, \phi_n \rangle \sim \mathcal{O}(n^m) \ \mbox{as}\ n\to\infty.
$$

for example $\langle \delta', \phi_n \rangle = -\phi_n'(0) \sim \mathcal{O}(n^{d+1})$

This behaviour reveals why distributions of higher order aren't representable by measures,
their growth rate under concentration is too rapid.
